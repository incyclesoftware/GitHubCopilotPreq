Go simple http server
=====================

To run this example, you need to have Go installed. You can install it by running the script `scripts/install_go.sh`.

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start a simple http server on port 8080. You can access it by opening a browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

**Running will take a few seconds to start.**, this is normal.
